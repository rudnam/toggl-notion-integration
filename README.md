# toggl-notion-integration

## Description

Modified Notion integration for Toggl's browser extension to automatically fill the time entry's project and tags based on properties from Notion.

## Notes

- Use inspect element to get the CSS Selector of desired property and change `PROJECT_NAME_CSS_PATH` and/or `TAGS_CSS_PATH`'s values accordingly.
- Currently does not work for multiple tags.
