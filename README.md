# toggl-notion-integration

## Description

Modified Notion integration for Toggl's browser extension to automatically fill the time entry's project and tags based on properties from Notion.

## Notes

- Replace `PROJECT_NAME_PROPERTY` and `TAGS_PROPERTY` with property names to get the values from.
- Has only been tested for properties of type `tag` so far.
- Currently does not work for multiple tags.
